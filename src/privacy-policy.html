    <h2 class="centerTextTitle">Pluto Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>
        This Policy explains how your personal data may be processed when you visit and use the <strong>Pluto Policy Manager DEMO app</strong>.
    </p>

    <h4>Data controller</h4>
    <p>
        According to <a href="https://www.gdpreu.org/" target="_blank">GDPREU.org</a>, the“Data Controller” determines the purposes of any personal data and the means of processing it.
        As the Pluto Policy Manager DEMO app does not collect ANY data, we also don’t have any official data protection officer
        and are no Data Controller as we have no control of  the procedures and purpose of data usage.
    </p>

    <h4>What we (do not) collect</h4>
    <p>
        We have built this app so that we do not collect any data from visitors for any purpose.
        Our only interests are informing you about our organization, enabling you to contact us and maintaining the security of the website, therefore:
    </p>
    <ul class="articleList">
        <li>We do not set any cookies at all on this site or your own device.</li>
        <li>We do not collect any data whatsoever about people who visit our site, unless you subscribe to our mailing list.</li>
        <li>We do not conduct any analysis of how people use our site.</li>
        <li>We do not allow third-party tracking of any kind on this site.</li>
        <li>We have licensed fonts from foundries that don’t entail usage tracking.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Information security</h4>
    <p>
        The Pluto Policy Manager DEMO app exclusively runs locally in the user’s
        browser tab and does not require any kind of middleware, server, or centralized storage.
        Therefore, no data can be stored anywhere else than in the local sandbox of the user’s browser.
    </p>

    <h4>Social media</h4>
    <p>
        We don’t use any social media.
    </p>

    <h4>Changes and revisions</h4>
